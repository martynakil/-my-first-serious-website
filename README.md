# -my-first-serious-website


My first 'serious' website, which I created for my master's thesis, but also to practice everything 

I've learned so far, i.e. HTML, CSS, JAVA SCRIPT and RWD.


The website works on the server:   https://foos-events.com/ 

------------------------------------------------
It was also the first commercial project for a client. I created the website for free, just to train.


-The website is fully responsive
-Thanks to the form on the website, the customer can send a message to the owner.
It works through an API that connects to the service and sends it messages.

I used here: EmailJS

Documentation: https://www.emailjs.com/docs/




Technologies: HTML, CSS, JAVA SCRIPT, RWD (Responsive web design).
