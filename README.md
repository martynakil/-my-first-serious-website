<h1> Website </h1>

*<h2>My first commercial project for a client :blue_book:</h2>*
>from the series: learning the basics of Java script  :muscle:

----

*The idea for doing this project was to look for friends who are currently looking for a website, but have no funds for it.
My goal was to do a project for someone, absolutely free - just for practice purposes.
I spent a lot of time on this project, but I also learned a lot.*

* the website is responsive, i.e. it looks good on all mobile devices
* is animated
* the message entered by the user is sent to the website owner
* the website is in two languages!:earth_africa:


This project is my first, I know I would do much better now, but still, I'm proud :thumbsup: :thumbsup: :thumbsup:

<h3>What did I use in the project? What have I learned?</h3>

* First of all, here I was learning how to get started with the project at all - what HTML structure I need
* I practiced CSS, and most of all [FLEXBOX](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox)
* How to position elements on the website
* [RWD](https://www.bluecorona.com/faq/what-is-a-responsive-website-design/)
* How to add a flyout menu to a page
* how to add and style a video on the website
* how to add pictures, how to arrange them well
* how to make the user change the language
* how to make animations
* how to send a message via the form(how to do form validation)
* how to add a website to the server

*I used [EMAILJS](https://www.emailjs.com/docs/) for the form
It works in such a way that the website connects to this service thanks to the API and it sends messages.*

<h3>How to open a file? :eyes: </h3>

* On the right side you will find the "clone or download" button - click it.
* An item should appear with the "Download ZIP" option - click again.
* Now you just need to unpack the downloaded file and open it in your favorite editor.
* and then "go live" is enough
